/* If your C implementation gives you access to some changing quantity, such
 * as the system clock, you can use that value (possibly truncated) to 
 * initialize the seed value. For instance, ANSI C has a time() function 
 * that returns the system time. The time units are system dependent, but 
 * what matters here is that the return value is an arithmetic type and that
 * its value changes with time. The exact type is system dependent and is 
 * given the label time_t, but you can use a type cast. Hereâ€™s the basic 
 * setup:
 *
 * srand((unsigned int) time(0));
 *
 * In general, time() takes an argument that is the address of a type
 * 'time_t' object.  In that case, the time value is also stored at that
 * address.  However, you can pass the NULL pointer (0) as an argument, in
 * which case the value is supplied only through the return value mechanism.
 *
 * The following is the prototype of the time() function in the <time.h>
 * header file.  On this system, the time_t type takes up 8 bytes (64 bits).
 *
 * time_t time(time_t *);
 *
 * time_t is an alias of a 'fundamental arithmetic type' which is capable of
 * representing times.  For historical resons, it is generally represented
 * as an integral value representing the number of seconds (not counting 
 * leap seconds) elapsed since 00:00:00, Thursday, January 1, 1970 UTC 
 * (i.e., a Unix timestamp).  The standard uses the term 'calendar time' 
 * when referring to a value of type 'time_t'.  Although libraries may use 
 * a different representation of time: Portable programs should not use the
 * value returned by this function directly, but always rely on calls to 
 * other elements of the standard library to translate them to portable 
 * types (such as localtime, gmtime or difftime).  If the object is not a 
 * NULL pointer, it also sets the return value to the object pointed to by
 * the time_t argument.  The return value is (time_t)(-1) on error.  
 * Implementations in which time_t is a 32-bit signed integer (many 
 * historical implementations) fail on January 19, 2038.
